We want to show "herstory" in East Asia from local perspectives with a timeline and a map in our local languages, so that people from different regions of East Asia can learn more about the stories and rights women and LGBETQ+ have fought for.
"Herstory in East Asia" project was launched in [Facing the Ocean Hackathon](https://g0v.hackmd.io/@chihao/HJuTOqB74?type=view) in Okinawa, Japan with contributors from Taiwan, Korea, Japan and Hong Kong. 
We realized that we have experienced similar culture repression and that we can learn from movements in other places, e.g. equality in workspace, law against sexual harrasement, right of abortion and campaigns against online hate speech. We knew too little on our neibours stories in gender equality.
We wish to publish the website to the public on March 3rd –Hina Matsuri– in Japan and March 8th – International Woman Day.
We want women in East Asia to know we have gone so far for the past 100 years and more can be done in the future.

## Steps To collaborate:

1. Collect and write herstory events in your country/region
    * On ["Sheet1-i18n"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-L6aI3TWipm4Rj995KLVg29bf7hCieuRdQ7jZkYkrAU/edit#gid=1683764614)...
        * `Title`: Event name and significance.
        * `Description`: Tell us more on what happened and its influence less than 150 words.
        * `Image`: Image says more than words.
        * `Source`: So people can know if it is trustable.
        * `Source URL`: For those who want to know more can explore
        * `Place`: it can be a specific park, a city or a country.
        * `Location`: The latitude and longitude of the `Location` is automatically generated by Google.
        * `Country/Region`
        * `Start` and `End` are for the years of that event started and ended. If it is not ended yet, please put 2020.
    * On ["Source"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-L6aI3TWipm4Rj995KLVg29bf7hCieuRdQ7jZkYkrAU/edit#gid=1245724333) sheet, please list down important sources for herstory events or advocacy, e.g. a timeline page of feminism movements.
    * Event select criteria
2. Translate herstory event descriptions into English
    * Please note that people from other countries may need more contexts to understand the stories, so you can add more explanation in English than in your local langangue version.
4. Translate herstory event from English to your local language
    * Let's make #herstory visualization page accessible for more readers in East Asia!
6. Don't forget to put your name/ID/nickname on the `Contributor_search` and `contributor_translate` to honor your contributions.
